        I enrolled in the Galvanize program because I developed a keen interest in
        the ability for the internet of things to collect information about societies.
        I see these as great tools for colleting data points that can be studied
        to help analyze social trends. Upon graduating from Galvanize I would love
        to work for a company that uses rich data collection to plot changes in workplaces,
        markets, societies, or our world as a whole.
